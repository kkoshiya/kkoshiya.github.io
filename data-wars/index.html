      <h1 class="blog-post-title">Data Wars</h1>

      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>I've been thinking a lot about the data wars. What the fuck am I even saying? I mean look, we all had to have known that at some point AI would become pervasive in society. Every day more data is being accumulated etc *input fav doomer cliche*. I think it'll be funny when normal people start to get automated and potentially lose their livelihood.</p>

        <p>It's kinda like those doujinshi where the husband needs to leave to find work, and his broke ass wife can't afford no food for the yungins so she secretly fucks the local merchants for food to feed her kids. At first they tell her they won't cum inside, but then they just end up filling her womb with baby batter and tell her to tell her husband it's his. Or if you westerners prefer some Greek classic of the poor citizen selling his daughters to men for salt.. Maybe you prefer a more 20th century pillage of East Berlin or Korean peninsula pleasure girls.. Brutal yes but some would say might is right. Always has been and we delude ourselves into thinking anything less. To me these are the stakes of the data wars. The world is quickly becoming a game of the haves and have nots, more than ever I'd argue. You can either enjoy your harem of other men's daughters and wives or you can pretend your son has your eyes.</p>

        <p>For me this is what keeps me up at night. Homes and stocks are retarded as the govt can seize them. Self custody crypto and gold/silver aren't a bad option but markets always change. Hackers could take your shit, a new coin could rise.. Maybe there's an asteroid farm, high tech mining or heavy element fusion.. At the end of the day what really is safe. What's gonna keep your foids safe? I think you just need might, and what is might in the age of the dawn of the data wars circa 2026+ ? I mean maybe some people will say bullets are the true doomsday weapon. But I like to try to think more macro, even if you substitute bullets for a large kinetic weapon etc. I can't answer that now, but maybe it's helpful to imagine how things might end up playing out.</p>

        <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Fiat debasement is rampant across the world. The US govt, currently still the largest economy/market is over 37 Trillion in bond debt, and over 200 Trillion in outstanding obligations such as Social Security etc. Europe is cooked as well in terms of economic output and fiat relevancy. Japan's yen is tanking as yields hit multi-decade highs. India spent decades selling their citizens the dream of learning basic IT white collar work to undercut the west, only to have AI out jeet them basically. Chinese youth are laying flat on the ground, enjoying their $300 monthly salaries and paying mortgages on plots in the ground. Russia does their violence to keep control of the people, no different than how USA uses Liberal wokism to distract the masses with their fraudulent joke elections, as China fear mongers their citizens that Taiwan, or Japan (revenge kink) or America is out to get them. Bread and circus, each govt has a different story or whatever. But to me it's more or less the same. If you can't keep your people happy with the state of the economy, they need something nationalistic. I grew up in America during the rise of cancel culture and wokism bullshit, a lot of retard youth bought into it. Now I'm starting to see gen Z wake up to the fact that all this liberal identity politics was a lie. People start to give less of a shit about gays or blacks or Palestine or whatever the fuck when they buy shit after their shifts at Amazon Warehouses, McDonalds or driving Uber/doordash. From what I've heard its similar in China, who gives a fuck what some jichan in Japan did inside your grandma's guts when you work 100 hours a week for a fat china foid in your parent's basement.</p>

        <p>I think the play might be to begin to automate as much of the world as possible. Most AI players focus on what I like to call the weapons, aka 'better' models and better suits (think Claude Cowork etc). Who is focusing on the data? Well I'd argue from 2010-2025 the game involved scraping the web and bending over for the shared NSA databases. But now adding more of that data seems a bit low signal. I wonder if the game is becoming more iterative, farming users prompts to see what they like, what they refuse, what they revert etc. This is why the paranoid buy 4 500gb m3 clusters to run Qwen locally. Anyways, maybe the play is to work with employers to keylog their employees and model out their day to tasks.. Begin the white collar cloning. Then just build tools that do what they do, iterate and only improve over time with each cleanse. Imagine how funny it'll be when white collar office workers go from upper middle class to defenseless overnight. When they are at the lowest, offer some FHE/iO ML service to keep their data private, their prompts etc. And then use that data for custom tuning or LoRAs. All encrypted and create better models than big AI. repay the profits back to user's via XMR or something idk. But basically, create the virus and sell them the cure when they are on the brink.</p>

        <p>This is why I've been trying to study Lattices since I landed in Japan. The data wars are coming, it's a brutal world out here and the longer you pretend it isn't (to cope) the worse it'll be. It's a feast or get feasted on world, it's gonna be a game of taking foids. Think about it like eating a dog. Sure you can eat a street dog, but doesn't it taste better knowing that someone put years of love and care into the creature.</p>
